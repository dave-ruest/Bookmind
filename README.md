# Bookmind

Bookmind *does* remember your your reading history and book collection. When your books exceed your memory, Bookmind can help. If you've found yourself wondering if you own or read #13 in that series, you need Bookmind.

Bookmind *doesn't*:
- Cost anything. The app is free. There are no limits to saved books, no premium version to buy in order to unlock features.
- Require signup. No need to create an account or remember yet another password. 
- Collect your data. Bookmind has no cloud, it *can't* store your data. 

Bookmind does infrequently show ads. If these ads generate enough revenue, we'll use it to add new features. So if you love Bookmind and want a feature added, tell your friends about the app!

# Availability

Bookmind 1.0 will be availabe on the app store soon! You will need an iPhone with iOS 17.0 or higher. I hope to add iPad and macOS support soon.

# For Employers

The *nearly* complete source code for Bookmind is stored in this public repository. You can see my coding style in every line, I wrote it all. The commit history and project demonstrate my development process, from de-risking to identifying and prioritizing tasks. Always tackle the biggest unknowns first.

## For Developers

The *nearly* complete source here demonstrates Swift, SwiftUI, Swift Data and VisionKit. I have not set a license for the code, so it is all copyrighted. But I do hope you find it instructive to see some of the workarounds required when you implement something more serious than the sample code provided for these technologies.

To run the app you will need
- Xcode 15 or later
- A development team to sign the app
- An iPhone with iOS 17 or later (the scanner does not work in simulator)
